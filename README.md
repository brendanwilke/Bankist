# Bankist

**Description**

This program is a pseudo-banking application that includes 4 example accounts to use. The accounts are able to transfer balances between each other, request loans, see their transactions, close their accounts, and more.

**Necessary Installations**

None. Just open up the HTML webpage.

**Usage**

Start by picking one of the accounts to use. The 4 example account usernames and passwords are:

* Username: js Password: 1111
* Username: jd Password: 2222
* Username: stw Password: 3333
* Username: ss Password: 4444

Once inside the account, there are many options to choose from. You will immediately see a list of transactions, the current balance, the interest gathered, total withdrawal amount, and deposit amounts. You can transfer money to another one of the accounts above by using their username and choosing an amount of money to send to that specific account. You can request a loan from the bank, but you must have at least 10% of the amount you are requesting within your account. You can also permanently close the account you are using (resets with a refresh of the page) by entering the username and password in the close account section.
